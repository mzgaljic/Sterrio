/** iCloud Document Sync makes it easy for developers to integrate the iCloud document storage APIs into iOS applications. This is how iCloud document-storage and management should've been out of the box from Apple. Integrate iCloud into iOS (OS X coming soon) Objective-C document projects with one-line code methods. Sync, upload, manage, and remove documents to and from iCloud with only a few lines of code (compared to the hundreds of lines and hours that it usually takes). Get iCloud up and running in your iOS app in only a few minutes. Updates and more details on this project can be found on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/iRareMedia/iCloudDocumentSync). If you like the project, please star it on GitHub!
 
 The `iCloud` class provides methods to integrate iCloud into document projects.
 
 Adding iCloud Document Sync to your project is easy. Follow these steps below to get everything up and running.
 
 1. Drag the iCloud Framework into your project
 2. Add `#import <iCloud/iCloud.h>` to your header file(s) iCloud Document Sync
 3. Subscribe to the `<iCloudDelegate>` delegate.
 4. Call the following methods to setup iCloud when your app starts:
 
    [[iCloud sharedCloud] setDelegate:self]; // Set this if you plan to use the delegate
    [[iCloud sharedCloud] setVerboseLogging:YES]; // We want detailed feedback about what's going on with iCloud, this is OFF by default
    [[iCloud sharedCloud] updateFiles]; // Force iCloud Update: This is done automatically when changes are made, but we want to make sure the view is always updated when presented
 
 
 @warning Only available on iOS 5.1 and later on apps with valid code signing and entitlements. Requires Xcode 5.0.1 and later. Check the online documentation for more information on setting up iCloud in your app. */

The Return value could be **NO** (iCloud Unavailable) for one or more of the following reasons:
 
   - iCloud is turned off by the user
   - The entitlements profile, code signing identity, and/or provisioning profile is invalid
 
 This method uses the ubiquityIdentityToken to check if iCloud is available. The delegate method iCloudAvailabilityDidChangeToState:withUbiquityToken:withUbiquityContainer: can be used to automatically detect changes in the availability of iCloud.

/** @name Uploading to iCloud */

/** Create, save, and close a document in iCloud.
 
 @discussion First, iCloud Document Sync checks if the specified document exists. If the document exists it is saved and closed. If the document does not exist, it is created then closed.
 
 iCloud Document Sync uses UIDocument and NSData to store and manage files. All of the heavy lifting with NSData and UIDocument is handled for you. There's no need to actually create or manage any files, just give iCloud Document Sync your data, and the rest is done for you.
 
 To create a new document or save an existing one (close the document), use this method. Below is a code example of how to use it.
 
    [[iCloud sharedCloud] saveAndCloseDocumentWithName:@"Name.ext" withContent:[NSData data] completion:^(UIDocument *cloudDocument, NSData *documentData, NSError *error) {
        if (error == nil) {
            // Code here to use the UIDocument or NSData objects which have been passed with the completion handler
        }
    }];
 
 Documents can be created even if the user is not connected to the internet. The only case in which a document will not be created is when the user has disabled iCloud or if the current application is not setup for iCloud.
 
 @param documentName The name of the document being written to iCloud. This value must not be nil.
 @param content The data to write to the document
 @param handler Code block called when the document is successfully saved. The completion block passes UIDocument and NSData objects containing the saved document and it's contents in the form of NSData. The NSError object contains any error information if an error occurred, otherwise it will be nil. */

/** Upload any local files that weren't created with iCloud
 
 @discussion Files in the local documents directory that do not already exist in iCloud will be **moved** into iCloud one by one. This process involves lots of file manipulation and as a result it may take a long time. This process will be performed on the background thread to avoid any lag or memory problems. When the upload processes end, the completion block is called on the main thread.
 
    [[iCloud sharedCloud] uploadLocalOfflineDocumentsWithRepeatingHandler:^(NSString *documentName, NSError *error) {
        if (error == nil) {

        }
     } completion:^{
         // Completion handler could be used to tell the user that the upload has completed
     }];
 
 This method may call the iCloudFileConflictBetweenCloudFile:andLocalFile: iCloud Delegate method if there is a file conflict.
 
 @param repeatingHandler Code block called after each file is uploaded to iCloud. This block is called every-time a local file is uploaded, therefore it may be called multiple times. The NSError object contains any error information if an error occurred, otherwise it will be nil.
