/** Use the iCloudDocument class (a subclass of UIDocument) to read and write documents managed by the iCloud class. You should rarely interact directly with iCloudDocument. The iCloud class manages all interactions with iCloudDocument. You can however retieve an iCloudDocument object by specifying its URL in the iCloud class.
 
 iCloudDocument can read and write any files with the following exceptions:
 
 - Bundles
 - Packages
 - Aliases
 
 If you'd like support for the above faux files then please consider [filing an Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/iRareMedia/iCloudDocumentSync/issues/new) or [submitting a Pull Request](https://github.com/iRareMedia/iCloudDocumentSync/pulls) if you've figured out how. This can be done using an NSFileWrapper. 
 
 You may want to consider subclassing iCloudDocument for custom implementations of many features. */
