### HOW TO USE
---

The image picker is created and displayed in a very similar way of the UIImagePickerController. The demo application shows how it is used.

```
ZCImagePickerController *imagePickerController = [[ZCImagePickerController alloc] init];
imagePickerController.imagePickerDelegate = self;
imagePickerController.maximumAllowsSelectionCount = 5;
imagePickerController.mediaType = ZCMediaAllAssets;
    
if ([UIDevice currentDevice].userInterfaceIdiom == UIUserInterfaceIdiomPad) {
        
	// You should present the image picker in a popover on iPad.
        
	_popoverController = [[UIPopoverController alloc] initWithContentViewController:imagePickerController];
	[_popoverController presentPopoverFromRect:_launchButton.frame inView:self.view permittedArrowDirections:UIPopoverArrowDirectionAny animated:YES];
}
else {
	// Full screen on iPhone and iPod Touch.
        
	[self.view.window.rootViewController presentViewController:imagePickerController animated:YES completion:NULL];
}
```

The ZCImagePickerController will return the select images back to the ZCImagePickerControllerDelegate. The delegate contains to methods very similar to the ZCImagePickerControllerDelegate. Instead of returning one dictionary representing a single image the controller sends back an array of similarly structured dictionaries. The two delegate methods are:

```
- (void)zcImagePickerController:(ZCImagePickerController *)imagePickerController didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:(NSArray *)info;
- (void)zcImagePickerControllerDidCancel:(ZCImagePickerController *)imagePickerController;
```
