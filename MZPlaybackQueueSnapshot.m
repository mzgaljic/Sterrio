/**
 * @brief Creates a snapshot of the queue in such a way that it becomes trivial to display graphically to
 *        the user.
 * @param songs all the songs that are to be displayed (graphically) to the user.
 * @param historySongsIndexSet  identifies which indexes in the 'songs' array are part of the users
 *                              history. Meaning, the user actually played these songs for at least x
 *                              seconds. These songs were previously played (and are not necessarily part of
 *                              the current queue.)
 * @param manuallyQueuedSongsIndexSet  Songs which have been manually queued up by the user.
 * @param index  index of the now playing song (at the time of QueueSnapshot creation.)
 * @param allFutureSongsIndexSet  Songs coming up in the main playback queue (not the temporary queue that
 *                                the user can build on the fly.) These are songs which have not been 
 *                                played.
